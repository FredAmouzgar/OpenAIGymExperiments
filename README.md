# OpenAIGymExperiments

The code presented here is my pre-experiments with PPO and REINFORCE algorithm before working on image captioning. Special thanks go to Nikhil Barhate as the PPO implementation is built on top of the code provided by <a href="https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch">nikhilbarhate99</a>.

This code mainly targeted the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/">LunarLander-V2</a> environment from the OpenAI Gym as shown below.
